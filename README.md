  Building a notification system is hard, at first, it seems like just sending an email but in reality,<br />
  it's just the beginning. In today's world users expect a multi-channel communication <br />
experience over email, SMS, push, direct, and more... 

An ever-growing list of providers is popping up each day, and notifications are spread around the code. 

<strong>Novu's goal is to simplify notifications and provide developers with the tools to create meaningful communication.</strong>

## 🚀 Getting Started
<br />
<details>
  <summary><strong>Self-hosted version </strong></summary>

  ##### `💡 Before you begin, make sure you have all the below installed:`

- [Node.js v14 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm v7 or above](https://github.blog/2020-10-13-presenting-v7-0-0-of-the-npm-cli/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/)

#### Project Setup
1. On your home `~/` directory create a `projects` folder.
    
    This will help you to organize all of your code in an accessible place in the terminal.
    
2. On GitHub desktop (or using git CLI) clone the project `novuhq/novu` into the newly created `projects` folder.
    
    As result, you will have the following directory structure:  `~/projects/novu/{CODE}`
    
3. For VSCode - click Open Workspace, as it would automatically organize folders in the best way:

![Untitled](novu/md/design assets/Untitled.png)

1. CD into the following: `~/projects/novu/`  and run the setup command: 
    1. (This won’t work if you don’t run the container before 😃 )

```bash
npm run setup:project
```

```markdown

💡 The command will run pnpm install and install all the dependencies for the services and generate local .env files.

```

## Running the project

There are 2 ways for you to run the project:

#### Global PNPM start **(Fastest)**

Run with - you will run all the projects on one terminal. As result, you won't be able to update or debug a specific service in isolation. 

#### Scoped service run

Select one service and run it under its directory with `pnpm start`. 
A good way for updating and testing specific services.

  We are excited to launch the complete Novu API and admin panel. Want to give it a test before the official release? here is how:

`npx novu init`

After setting up your account using the cloud or docker version you can trigger the API using the `@novu/node` package.

`npm install @novu/node`

```typescript

import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu(process.env.NOVU_API_KEY);

await novu.trigger('<TRIGGER_NAME>',
  {
    to: {
      subscriberId: '<UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER>',
      email: 'john@doemail.com',
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe',
    },
    payload: {
      name: "Hello World",
      organization: {
        logo: 'https://happycorp.com/logo.png',
      },
    },
  }
);

```

## Embeddable notification center

Using the Novu API and admin panel you can easily add real-time notification center to your web-app without the hassle of building it yourself. You can use our React component or an iframe embed if you are not using React.
